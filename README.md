### üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Data Using MCP**

**"Weather Data Using MCP"** is a project that integrates **real-time weather information** with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** framework. It demonstrates how environmental data (like temperature, humidity, or wind speed) can be fetched, processed, and shared across systems using the standardized and interoperable structure provided by MCP.

This project can serve as a practical use case for:

* **Digital twins** that simulate environmental conditions.
* **Model-based systems** that rely on real-world data.
* **Context-aware applications** that respond to weather changes.

### üîß Key Features:

* Fetches live weather data using APIs.
* Structures data using **MCP models**.
* Publishes context-aware weather updates.
* Enables toolchain communication for simulations or smart applications.
